# API Key Integration Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive API key integration features that have been added to the Image Flow Editor application.

## Overview

The application has been updated to allow users to provide their own Gemini Flash image preview API key instead of relying on hardcoded environment variables. This makes the application more user-friendly and secure.

## Features Added

### 1. API Key Configuration Component (`ApiKeyConfig.tsx`)
- **Modal dialog** for API key input with secure password field
- **Validation** to ensure API key format is correct (starts with "AI" and minimum length)
- **Show/hide password** functionality for better UX
- **Visual indicators** showing configuration status
- **Local storage integration** for persistence
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages

### 2. Instructions Component (`ApiKeyInstructions.tsx`)
- **Step-by-step guide** for obtaining a Gemini API key
- **Direct links** to Google AI Studio
- **Security warnings** about API key protection
- **Visual design** with numbered steps and icons
- **Additional information** about pricing, models, and troubleshooting

### 3. Updated Gemini Service (`geminiService.ts`)
- **Dynamic API key setting** instead of environment variable dependency
- **Validation** to ensure API key is configured before making requests
- **Error handling** for missing API key scenarios
- **Backward compatibility** with existing code structure

### 4. Enhanced Main Application (`App.tsx`)
- **New tab** for instructions alongside Editor and Dashboard
- **Status banners** showing API key configuration state
- **Local storage management** for API key persistence
- **Error handling** for workflow execution without API key
- **Settings integration** with FlowEditor component

### 5. Updated FlowEditor (`FlowEditor.tsx`)
- **Settings button** for quick access to API key configuration
- **Consistent UI** integration with existing toolbar
- **Optional prop** for API key configuration handler

### 6. Styling Enhancements (`index.css`)
- **Dark theme** optimization for all new components
- **Kendo UI overrides** for consistent appearance
- **Custom animations** and transitions
- **Responsive design** considerations

## Security & Privacy Features

### Local Storage
- API keys are stored locally in the browser using `localStorage`
- No transmission to external servers except Google's Gemini API
- Automatic cleanup when keys are cleared

### Validation
- Client-side validation of API key format
- Error messages for invalid keys
- Prevention of empty key submissions

### User Education
- Clear security warnings in the instructions
- Best practices documentation
- Privacy policy information

## User Experience Improvements

### Visual Indicators
- **Green banner** when API key is configured
- **Yellow banner** when API key is missing
- **Status icons** and clear messaging
- **Progress feedback** during configuration

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard navigation** support
- **Screen reader friendly** labels and descriptions
- **High contrast** color schemes for visibility
- **Responsive design** for mobile devices

### Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation** when API key is missing
- **Clear error messages** with actionable guidance
- **Validation feedback** before API calls
- **Retry mechanisms** for failed operations

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- React hooks for local component state
- useCallback for performance optimization
- useEffect for initialization and cleanup
- Centralized API key state in main App component

### Type Safety
- TypeScript interfaces for all new components
- Proper type definitions for API responses
- Error boundary considerations
- Strict type checking enabled

### Performance
- Lazy loading of components
- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo potential
- Optimized local storage operations
- Minimal bundle size impact

## Getting Started for Users

1. **Open the application**
2. **Click "Instructions" tab** to see detailed setup guide
3. **Follow step-by-step instructions** to get Gemini API key
4. **Click "Configure API Key"** button
5. **Enter and save the API key**
6. **Start using image editing features**
